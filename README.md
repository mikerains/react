# Mike Next Steps
0. Understand Ui-Router's ViewConfigFactory.  See the sample app https://github.com/ui-router/react/blob/master/src/core.ts
1. Redux and UI-Router in Dynamots on 2 pages: Reddit and Appconfig
2. Offline State
3. Preserve state between sessions
4. Lazyloading
5. Doing it all with Create-React_app, see https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#making-a-progressive-web-app


# Curently I am implementing
./dynamots

## This Sample App which uses ViewFactory: 

https://github.com/ui-router/react/blob/master/src/core.ts

That got me into this documentation: https://ui-router.github.io/react/docs/latest/modules/react.html#viewconfigfactory

and this: https://ui-router.github.io/react/docs/latest/interfaces/react.reactstatedeclaration.html#lazyload

and this: https://ui-router.github.io/react/docs/latest/classes/react.uirouterreact.html


Incidentally refering to FB React Documentation at: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/conditional-rendering.html

## Offline Apps

## Client side Routing
To get Client-Side Routing to work, I needed to configure express server.  See reduxjsAsync and https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#serving-apps-with-client-side-routing

See ./reduxjsAsync/server.js, which I gleaned from ./reactrouter/react-router-tutorial/lessons/13-server-rendering/server.js, and which came from https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-tutorial
